# The Grid: Molly.AI wishlist

### Stacie:

## Philosophically:

* Create an entire page/site with minimal input on design choices from me
  * ie, I provide the content/building blocks, and Molly gets to work.
* _**Really surprise me**_
* **Design** some crazy **bad** things
* **Design** some crazy **good** things
* Give Molly**some initial direction** in the purpose of my site (maybe v3)
* Or, enter content and **have Molly intuit, summarize and categorize **what I may want the direction to be (v3 clustering?)
* Have a **logical and pleasant** user interface/experience.

## Functionally:

* **Date and Time stamps** available to be included on the posts. (When)
* S**ignature/Ownership**: Have option to **attach the user profile/sig to appropriate article**. (Author)
* **Weighted Importance**: Tell Molly that something in a section is more or less important.
  * A less important item, like an image, should be smaller, or less saturated or otherwise less emphasized than the other items it's posted with.
  * A more important item could be promoted to Header text, or header graphic, or have all the other items displayed around it.
* Be able to **share links to any part of the page **that Molly makes. (a share option to copy the generated url, how else can we post things on social media?)
  * This is currently possible using the _ugly generated ID _for content.
  * You end up with a link like this: [http://ghostinthewell.com/\#section-v\_ArticleTitle2x-761f94db-14aa-4051-a85b-abae7333a4de][0]
    * This is **an ugly, non human readable, non SEO optimized kind of link. **_Poor form, Molly!_
  * I used the browser inspector and grabbed the section id and added it to my url.
![Use your browser inspector, right click on the article/section you want to deep link, copy the id and then construct your link YourURL.ai#(the id you just copied)](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8b822721-fafa-4578-94cf-811742c1a2e0.png)

* Have a **media manager**, (confirmed for v3)
* Iterate designs much faster, allow me to give input.(coming in v3?)
* Auto **pull in feeds** of my other sites or social networks.
  * "Hey, I noticed you've linked to that site with that account several times, shall I automatically post updates from there to this Grid site?"
* Ability to**pin** certain articles or objects **to the top** of the homepage
* Ability to **merge posts together**
* Allow for**tagging of posts**
* Ability to group, or have Molly auto tag items.
* Support [Markdown][1] for editing/composing text. [More info @Daring Fireball][2]
  * Companies who support at least some markdown:
    * [Github][3]
    * [Bitbucket][4]

## Usability:

* **Add Accessibility warnings for color/font choices.**
  * [Auto Select Accessible Colors][5]
* Add **settings/preferences for the admin experience**. IE color theme/font sizes, animations on or off.
* **Add Revision history**. Date/time/last edited by information.
* **Choice of different sizes for headers images/videos** (both in app and on site) _Currently wasting space 'above the fold'_

### Hera K:

* Order posts in a**non-animated environment**
