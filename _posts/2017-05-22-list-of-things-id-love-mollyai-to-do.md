# The Grid: Molly.AI wishlist

### Stacie:

Function

* Be able to share links to any part of the page that Molly makes. (a share option to copy the generated url)
  * This is currently possible using the ugly generated ID for content.
  * You end up with a link like this: http://ghostinthewell.com/\#section-v\_ArticleTitle2x-761f94db-14aa-4051-a85b-abae7333a4de
  * But not easy for people to make these links. I used the browser inspector and grabbed the section id and added it to my url. ![Use your browser inspector, right click on the article/section you want to deep link, copy the id and then construct your link YourURL.ai#(the id you just copied)](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8b822721-fafa-4578-94cf-811742c1a2e0.png)

* Have a **media manager**, (confirmed for v3)
* Iterate designs much faster, allow me to give input.(coming in v3?)
* Auto **pull in feeds** of my other sites or social networks.
* Give Molly**some initial direction** in the purpose of my site (maybe v3)
* Or, enter content and **have Molly intuit, summarize and categorize **what I may want the direction to be (v3 clustering?)
* _**Really surprise me**_
* **Design** some crazy **bad** things
* **Design** some crazy **good** things
* Allow for**tagging of posts**
* Have option to **attach the user profile/sig to appropriate article**.
* **Date and Time stamps** available to be included on the posts.
* **Add Accessibility warnings for color/font choices.**
* Ability to**pin** certain articles or objects **to the top** of the homepage
* **Choice of different sizes for headers images/videos** (both in app and on site) _Currently wasting space 'above the fold'_
* Ability to **merge posts together**

Usability:

* Add **settings/preferences for the admin experience**. IE color theme/font sizes, animations on or off.
* **Add Revision history**. Date/time/last edited by information.

### Hera K:

* Order posts in a**non-animated environment**
