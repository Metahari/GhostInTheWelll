  For the past five years, the hottest thing in artificial intelligence has been
  a branch known as deep learning. The grandly named statistical technique, put
  simply, gives computers a way to learn by processing vast amounts of data.
  Thanks to deep learning, computers can easily identify faces and recognize
  spoken words, making other forms of humanlike intelligence suddenly seem
  within reach.
