  I used Pandorabots to power Skyvi, a.k.a. "Siri for Android:" a mobile
  application that used voice recognition and speech synthesis technology to
  enable people to talk to their very own personal assistant in natural
  language. Skyvi obeyed commands like look up the weather or post to Facebook,
  and even held witty, intelligent conversations.
