  Last year Apple launched Swift Playgrounds, a project to teach coding in a fun
  and easy manner that kids would enjoy. Swift Playgrounds teaches computer
  programming through a nifty iPad app. The interface is similar to sites like
  Codecademy, but it's more colorful and visually entertaining, making it
  perfect for kids.
