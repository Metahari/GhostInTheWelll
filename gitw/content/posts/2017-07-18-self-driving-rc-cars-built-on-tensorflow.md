  Otavio and Will were showing off their autonomous vehicles at Maker Faire.
  These are not the self-driving cars you get around town in, they're RC
  vehicles that are inexpensive to experiment with. Otavio talks us through some
  test race footage and Will tells us about the Donkey Car you can build for
  about $200 in parts if you want to give autonomous RC a try.
