  Artificial intelligence owes a lot of its smarts to Judea Pearl. In the 1980s
  he led efforts that allowed machines to reason probabilistically. Now he's one
  of the field's sharpest critics. In his latest book, " The Book of Why: The
  New Science of Cause and Effect," he argues that artificial intelligence has
  been handicapped by an incomplete understanding of what intelligence really
  is.
