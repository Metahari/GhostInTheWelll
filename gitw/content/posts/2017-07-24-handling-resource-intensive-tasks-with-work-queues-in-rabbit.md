  All computationally intensive work at The Grid; such as image analysing, and
  image processing are off-loaded as jobs in RabbitMQ. Instead of having a web
  server waiting for a result immediately, it is free to keep processing other
  requests. All jobs that are added to the queue are consumed by Heroku workers
  running with MsgFlo.
